Ran to the store to get a few basics; bumped into a friend from work. Afterwards, I realized that I hadn’t even noticed that she changed her hair color. Probably wouldn’t have been polite to mention it. Met Mark at the subway station, decided on Burger King and a movie. Mimi was extra loud meowing at us when we got home later than normal."
